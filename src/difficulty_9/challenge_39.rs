// A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students. 
// 
// The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, 
// using in each case any two numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication. 
// The system should ask studentâ€™s name, then ask 10 questions, 
// output if the answer to each question is correct or not and produce a final score out of 10.
//
// Scores from the quiz should be stored and added to when a student takes a new quiz.
//
// Write an algorithm for the process described above.
